abstract: 'Cyber-physical systems are integrations ofcomputation, communication networks, and physicaldynamics. Applications include aircraft,manufacturing, transportation, energy productionand distribution, biomedical, smart buildings,automobiles, and military systems, to name a few.Increasingly, today, such systems leverageInternet technology, despite a significantmismatch in technical objectives. A majorchallenge today is to make this technologyreliable, predictable, and controllable enough for"important" things, such as safety-critical andmission-critical systems. In this talk, I willoutline an effort at Berkeley to develop an openarchitecture for composition of things andservices that can improve composability andpredictability. In particular, I examine the rolethat deterministic models, particularly withregard to timing, can play in an increasinglynondeterministic environment.'

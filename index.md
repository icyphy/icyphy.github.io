The goal of iCyPhy (pronounced _eye-sigh-fie_) is to conduct pre-competitive research on architectures and design, modeling, and analysis techniques for cyber-physical systems, with emphasis on industrial applications. Cyber-physical systems integrate computing, networking, and physical components. Applications include transportation systems, automation, security, smart buildings, smart cities, medical systems, energy generation and distribution, water distribution, agriculture, military systems, process control, asset management, and robotics.

The CPS intellectual challenge is about the intersection, not the union, of the physical and the cyber. This intersection combines engineering models and methods from mechanical, environmental, civil, electrical, biomedical, chemical, aeronautical and industrial engineering with the models and methods of computer science and engineering. iCyPhy research is founded on the conviction that these models and methods do not combine easily, and that consequently CPS constitutes a new engineering discipline that demands its own models and methods.

ICyPhy is a collaborative effort between academia in the [EECS Department at UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) and industry. ICyPhy [member companies](/membership/) provide financial support for research projects, interact collaboratively with researchers, and commercialize research results.

Specific current research directions include:

* Embedded and real-time systems and software.
* Model-based design of cyber-physical systems.
* The Internet of things (IoT).
* Safety, privacy, and security for IoT.
* Synthesis and learning for cyber-physical system design and adaptation.
* Software and network architectures for heterogeneous distributed IoT applications.
* Systems-of-systems design.
* Semantics of timed systems.

abstract: 'We are less in control of the trajectory of technology development than we realize. The tools we use, themselves earlier outcomes of engineering efforts, shape our thinking more than we think. Technology is coevolving with humanity, and natural selection plays as least as big a role as top-down intelligent design. Perhaps accepting this reality can lead to more effective policies.'

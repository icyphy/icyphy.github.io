abstract: 'We introduce a platform-based design methodologythat uses contracts to specify and abstract thecomponents of a cyber-physical system (CPS), andprovide formal support to the entire CPS designflow. The design is carried out as a sequence ofrefinement steps from a high-level specificationto an implementation built out of a library ofcomponents at the lower level. We reviewformalisms and tools that can be used to specify,analyze, or synthesize the design at differentlevels of abstraction. For each level, wehighlight how the contract operations can beconcretely computed as well as the researchchallenges that should be faced to fully implementthem. We illustrate our approach on the design ofembedded controllers for aircraft electric powerdistribution systems.'

abstract: "We argue that the utility of time as a semantic property of software is not limited to the domain of real-time systems. This paper outlines four concurrent design patterns: alignment, precedence, simultaneity, and consistency, all of which are relevant to general-purpose software applications. We show that a semantics of logical time provides a natural framework for reasoning about concurrency, makes some difficult problems easy, and offers a quantified interpretation of the CAP theorem, enabling quantified evaluation of the tradeoff between consistency and availability."

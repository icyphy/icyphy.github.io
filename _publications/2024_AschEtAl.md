abstract: "This paper introduces software-defined watchdogs, a programming model for handling faults that manifest as delayed or missing signals. The programming model is implemented as an extension to the polyglot coordination language LINGUA FRANCA, where it acts as an eager deadline for delayed inputs. The technique is compared against hardware-defined watchdogs and software watchdogs in other reactive languages."

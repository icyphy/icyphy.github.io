abstract: "Computer architectures used in safety-critical domains are subjected to worst-case execution time analysis. The presence of performance-driven microarchitectures may trigger undesired timing phenomena, called timing anomalies, and complicate the timing analysis. This paper investigates pipelines specifically designed to simplify the worst-case execution time analysis (also called predictable pipelines). We propose formal and executable models of four research-oriented pipelines and one industrial pipeline to validate some of their claims related to their timing behavior. We indeed validate, via bounded model checking, the absence of a type of timing anomalies called amplification timing anomalies, or its potential presence by identifying prerequisite to situations where they can occur."

abstract: 'In the Logical Execution Time (LET) principle, concurrent software components interact deterministically, reading their inputs atomically at the start of a task and producing outputs atomically after a fixed elapsed logical time. In addition to deterministic concurrency, LET programs
yield more deterministic timing when they interact with their physical environment through sensors and actuators. This paper shows through a series of examples that the LET principle can be realized flexibly and generalized using the Lingua Franca coordination language.'

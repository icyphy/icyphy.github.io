abstract: "Lingua Franca is a programming paradigm that eases the development of distributed cyber-physical systems and ensures determinism. These systems are subject to stringent timing constraints, generally expressed as task deadlines, and meeting them requires real-time scheduling. This work presents a layered scheduling strategy for Lingua Franca for enhanced real-time performance that builds upon any priority-based operating system thread scheduler. The application designers need to specify only the application-specific deadlines, and the Lingua Franca runtime automatically converts them into appropriate priority values for the OS scheduler to obtain earliest deadline first scheduling."

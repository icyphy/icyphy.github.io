abstract: "This paper describes a component-based concurrent model of computation for reactive systems. The components in this model, featuring ports and hierarchy, are called reactors. The model leverages a semantic notion of time, an event scheduler, and a synchronous-reactive style of communication to achieve determinism. Reactors enable a programming model that ensures determinism, unless explicitly abandoned by the programmer. We show how the coordination of reactors can safely and transparently exploit parallelism, both in shared-memory and distributed systems."

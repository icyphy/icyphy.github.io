title: "Invited: Actors Revisited for Time-Critical Systems"
booktitle: ' Design Automation Conference (DAC)'
month: 'June'
abstract: "Programming time-critical systems is notoriously difficult. In this paper we propose an actor-oriented programming model with a semantic notion of time and a deterministic coordination semantics based on discrete events to exercise precise control over both the computational and timing aspects of the system behavior"

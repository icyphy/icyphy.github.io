title: "Service Discovery for the Connected Car with Semantic Accessors"
journal: 'IEEE Inteligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)'
abstract: "Connected cars have the potential to transform a vehicle from a transportation platform to a platform for integrating humans with a city. To that end we introduce semantic accessors (actor based local proxies for remote ser- vices) as a novel, and powerful discovery mechanism for connected vehicles that bridges the domains of Internet of Things (IoT) composition frameworks and the semantic web of things. The primary components of this approach include a local semantic repository used for maintaining the vehicleâ€™s perspective of its real-world context, accessors for querying and dynamically updating the repository to match evolving vehicular context information, accessors for services (such as parking) linked to a service ontology, and a swarmlet controller responsible for managing the above in accordance with user input. We demonstrate this semantic accessor architecture with a prototype Dashboard display that downloads accessors for new services as they become available and dynamically renders their self-described user interface components."

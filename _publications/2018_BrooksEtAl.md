abstract: 'We describe a component-based softwarearchitecture for the Internet of Things in whichproxies for Things and services that we call"accessors" interact with one another under aconcurrent, time-stamped, discrete-event (DE)semantics. These proxies are analogous to webpages, which proxy a cloud-based service such as abank, but instead of being designed to interfacethose services with humans, accessors are designedto interface services and Things with otherservices and Things. A deterministic DE semanticsis combined with a widely used pattern forhandling network interactions that we call"asynchronous atomic callbacks" (AAC). AAC enablesmany concurrent pending requests to be active atonce without blocking and without the treacherousconcurrency pitfalls of threads. In effect, ourarchitecture combines AAC with actors where theactor model has been endowed with a temporalsemantics. We show how this architecture canleverage the previously reported Secure SwarmToolkit (SST) to achieve state-of-the-artauthentication, authorization, and encryption ofinteractions across networks.'

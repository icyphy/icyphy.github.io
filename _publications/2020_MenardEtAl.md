abstract: "AUTOSAR Adaptive Platform (AP) is an emerging industry standard that tackles the challenges of modern auto-motive software design, but does not provide adequate mechanisms to enforce deterministic execution. This poses profound challenges to testing and maintenance of the application software, which is particularly problematic for safety-critical applications. In this paper, we analyze the problem of nondeterminism in AP and propose a framework for the design of deterministic automotive software that transparently integrates with the AP communication mechanisms. We illustrate our approach in a case study based on the brake assistant demonstrator application that is provided by the AUTOSAR consortium. We show that the original implementation is nondeterministic and discuss a deterministic solution based on our framework."

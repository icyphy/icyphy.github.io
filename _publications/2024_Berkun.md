title: 'Concurrency Without Threads for Multicore Microprocessors'
abstract: 'Cyber-physical systems are often deployed in settings where low cost and power consumption are required, traditionally favoring single-core processors. However, as computer processors fall in cost and rise in capabilities, multi-core processors are becoming increasingly prevalent. This necessitates the use of a software system, such as a real-time operating system (RTOS), to help create and manage concurrent tasks. However, the use of an RTOS comes with several disadvantages, including scheduler overhead and inefficient memory usage. We develop LTA (Library for Timing-aware Actors), and adapt Lingua Franca, a polyglot coordination language, as alternative concurrency systems. We demonstrate that these thread-less concurrency systems can offer more precise timing than an RTOS, while also consuming less memory.'

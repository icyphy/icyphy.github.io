abstract: "This report is a compilation of technical knowledge and concepts that were produced by the authors and additional contributors in the context of the collaboration projects "Abstraction Requirements for Language of Choice in Industrial Automation" (FY21-22) and "Approaches for Robust and Safe Low-Code" (FY23-24) from Siemens Technology and the University of California, Berkeley. The primary objective of these projects was to assess Siemens Open Industrial Edge (OIE) engineering capabilities by defining a concept that ensures the satisfaction of coordination and safety requirements when using disparate OIE modules. The objective was to use the Lingua Franca (LF) coordination language to demonstrate how to address challenges in: 1. engineering modular, distributed, and flexible automation solutions that ensure, by design, robust and safe operation1; 2. the use of IEC 61499, the event driven execution model for specifying the execution order of OIE modules (defined as function blocks); 3. support large-scale distributed OIE automation solutions, and eventually 4. define optimal solutions with synchronization and time-optimal mechanisms."

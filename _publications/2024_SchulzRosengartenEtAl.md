abstract: "Behavior Trees (BTs) provide a lean set of control flow elements that are easily composable in a modular tree structure. They are well established for modeling the high-level behavior of non-player characters in computer games and recently gained popularity in other areas such as industrial automation. While BTs nicely express control, data handling aspects so far must be provided separately, e. g. in the form of blackboards. This may hamper reusability and can be a source of nondeterminism. We here propose a dataflow extension to BTs that explicitly models data relations and communication. We realize and validate that approach in the recently introduced polyglot coordination language Lingua Franca (LF)."
